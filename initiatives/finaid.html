          “<b>The Herald's financial assistance program allowed me to embark on one of the greatest learning experiences of my life.</b>” <p>— Chris Hatfield '06, Executive Editor</p>

          "<b>The Herald's financial assistance program gave me the breathing room to become more involved with campus journalism</b>. Working at The Herald was <b>one of the most rewarding and educational opportunities I have ever had. Without the help of the paper's alums and the financial assistance program, I would not have been able to have the wonderful experiences that I did.</b>” <p>— Ross Frazier '09, Editor-in-Chief</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>The Herald is produced entirely by a volunteer student staff. Given the significant time committment required at The Herald, some students need to make difficult decisions about how much time they can devote to The Herald.</p>
      
        <p>Funded initially by a general Herald alum, the financial aid program begin in 2006. Stipends of between $400 and $1,250 are awarded to students on a need-based, confidential basis. </p>

        <p>Gifts of any amount support this program, and all gifts to The Herald are tax deductible. A gift of $17,500 would endow one semester of stipends, and $500,000 would permanently endow the program.</p>
